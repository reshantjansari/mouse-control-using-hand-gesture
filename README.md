The objective of this project is to create a system that allows a user to control the mouse on their computer using hand gestures.
This includes moving the cursor, clicking, scrolling, dragging, zooming, and other common actions performed with a mouse. The system uses a webcam to
capture hand gestures and the Mediapipe library for hand landmark detection. 



Technology Used
OpenCV
        contains techniques for processing images that detect objects. 
MediaPipe
      MediaPipe is a Google open-source framework that is applied 
      in a machine learning pipeline.
PyAutoGUI
      Allows users to imitate keyboard button pushes as well as
      mouse cursor movements and clicks.
PyMath
       The Python math module gives you the possibility to perform
       common and useful mathematical operations within your program.

Python will be used for implementing the core logic of the virtual mouse system, including image processing, gesture recognition, and real-time processing. 
Its extensive libraries and community support make it suitable for integrating different components of the system efficiently.


Future Scope

Advanced Gesture Recognition Techniques
Enhanced User Interface and Interaction
Accessibility and Customization
Mobile and IoT Integration
